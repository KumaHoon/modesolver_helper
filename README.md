# Introduction
I've practice to solve modes in optical-waveguide by using modesolverpy in lab practice course in my university.
However, It seems there are some problems when you run modesolverpy in Windows.
So, I make a decision to help running modesolverpy in windows. 
And also, There are some example codes in this repository.
